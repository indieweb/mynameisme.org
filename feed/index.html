				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mynameisme.org/files/2011/09/1985.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-635" src="http://mynameisme.org/files/2011/09/1985-300x266.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>My name is Jamie Zawinski, though far more people know me as &#8220;jwz&#8221;. I was one of the founders of <a href="http://home.mcom.com/">Netscape</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla.org</a>, have been involved in the open source software community since the mid-80s, and have been blogging since before that was even a thing. I ended up with the handle &#8220;jwz&#8221; because that was the custom in hacker culture at the time. It stuck.</p>
<p>When I introduce myself to someone as &#8220;Jamie&#8221;, the response is often, &#8220;Wait, do you mean jwz?&#8221; They often seem perplexed that I&#8217;m using that other name. Nobody knows who &#8220;Jamie&#8221; is, but a lot of people know this &#8220;jwz&#8221; person.</p>
<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve collaborated on and managed software projects with many hundreds of volunteer contributors, and I almost never knew any of their &#8220;real&#8221; names. Their work and their reputations spoke for them, not the trivia of what their parents happened to call them.</p>
<p>When you are young, most people don&#8217;t take you seriously.</p>
<p>I was 15 years old when I got my first job programming. I can tell you firsthand that the shield of a pseudonym can be a useful tool to have people judge you by your skills and accomplishments rather than by whatever prejudices they bring.</p>
<p>There have been occasions when I learned that a long-time contributor to one of my projects was still a teenager. Doubtless there have been occasions where that was true but I never found out, because the person didn&#8217;t volunteer it, and it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how it should be. &#8220;On the Internet, nobody knows you&#8217;re a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside of software collaborations, I&#8217;ve been a participant in many other online communities where pseudonyms were the norm rather than the exception, starting with USENET and BBSes, and including sites like LiveJournal, my own blog, and the blogs of others. The idea that somehow &#8220;real names&#8221; are more inherently trustworthy or polite flies in the face of my experience.</p>

<p>My name is <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>, and I study social media. I live in the United States, a democracy that spends many millions of dollars a year guaranteeing citizens the right to vote without being identified. This practice of de-coupling identity from political action has been ratified by over a century of law and practice, and protects people from intimidation over their most important duty as citizens. To preserve the political value of our digital tools, people need to be able to speak their minds without fear of reprisal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mynameisme.org/files/2011/08/Sarah-Stokely1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-618" src="http://mynameisme.org/files/2011/08/Sarah-Stokely1-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>My name is Sarah Stokely. I am the vice-chair of Electronic Frontiers Australia, the peak online civil liberties group in Australia. I have taught digital media and web publishing at the University of Melbourne. Prior to that, I was a longtime technology journalist, blogger, and editor.</p>
<p>I also have a persistent pseudonym I use on several online communities which is older than the minimum age for joining Facebook. I learned how to behave in a civil manner online from communities where pseudonyms were the norm. So I know that you don’t need to use real names to have civil community online.<br />
As an educator, I’ve long been dedicated to bridging the digital divide and making technology and the internet more accessible and our online culture more diverse. I am very concerned that mandating real names online will have a detrimental effect on free speech, resulting in less diversity in online culture and conversation, and less participation by minorities. I am very concerned that the voices of vulnerable people, such as political activists or commentators in countries without free speech protections, will be silenced if real names are required for them to participate online.</p>
<p>Pseudonyms can allow people to go about their business online in safety &#8211; whether that’s playing an online game, blogging their political opinions, or having a presence online without worrying that a violent ex-partner might track them down. I learned this from an extremely safe position of privilege as a middle class woman in a democratic country. My profession and hobbies mean I’ve spent a long time in male-dominated environments online (from MMO gaming to participating in tech conferences). So I know from experience that sometimes just being a visible minority can make you a target for harrassment. But there are people in the world who would risk more than I ever could, simply by using their real names, identifying with their real gender, or expressing their political beliefs. In countries with government-controlled broadcast media, the internet may be the only medium of free speech available to people.<br />
We need to ensure that people who hold unpopular political or religious statements can continue to express those views online.</p>
<p>We need to remember when we create policies and laws for online behaviour, that must aim to create the best possible outcome for all users of the internet, not just our privileged selves.</p>
<p>Some people have argued that mandating real names is a way to make people more accountable and more civil online. While I&#8217;d love to see more civil conduct online, I do not believe that mandating the use of real names will achieve this goal. Furthermore, as we&#8217;ve seen in the beta of Google Plus, Google&#8217;s new online social network, real name policies are technically very difficult to implement successfully. There have already been numerous documented cases of people whose legal names were rejected by Google Plus, either because the person only has one legal name, or because Google&#8217;s naming system couldn&#8217;t cope with people&#8217;s non-English language names.</p>
<p>Attempts by governments or companies to enforce real name policies to ensure great civility or accountability online (or greater income for advertising companies) will have a disproportionate, chilling effect on free speech of the most vulnerable minorities online. The cost to free speech would far outweigh any gain in civility or online accountability.</p>
<p>Anonymous and pseudonymous speech as a tool for political dissent pre-dates the internet, and must be maintained in the internet age as well. As the internet plays an increasingly large role in the way we express ourselves and create our cultures and societies, we should be very concerned about companies or governments which seek to mandate real name policies online, to the detriment of free speech, personal safety and privacy.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I support the right to choose one’s own name online.</p>

</a>My name is Andie. I write about motherhood from various perspectives, including feminist, economic, political, and personal. I am the author of the blog <a href="http://www.bluemilk.wordpress.com/">blue milk</a> and also a contributing author to the book, <a href="http://www.demeterpress.org/21CenturyMotherhood.html">The 21st Century Motherhood Movement: Mothers Speak Out On Why We Need To Change the World And How To Do It</a>. I have presented at conferences, had my work quoted on television, and written for magazines, newspapers and blogs. Although I write sometimes under my own name, when I write about parenthood I often write under a pseudonym, one that I have been using for the past four years. As a parent I need to be mindful of the fact that my writing can compromise the privacy, and even the safety, of my two young children. And as my anonymity has inevitably declined, so too has my appetite for exploring the more contentious areas of parenthood &#8211; such as sexuality, parenting regrets, and negotiations with my partner. This is unfortunate, because everyone loves a good parenting confession, and one of my main reasons for writing was to get things like this off my chest. Motherhood, at least in terms of the mainstream, is cautious, conservative and competitive. Each of these stifles proper debate and discussion. We can ensure more adventurous, truthful and informative discussion about parenthood by allowing writers to take risks in their story-telling and we&#8217;ll do that by maintaining the avenue of anonymity for those who need it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://old-mnim.chezskud.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gwyn-Profile-Picture-July-2011.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-589" src="http://mynameisme.org/files/2011/08/Gwyn-Profile-Picture-July-2011-350x350-300x300.jpg" alt="Sepia image of Gwenyth's Second Life avatar" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>My name is Gwyneth Llewelyn, and I&#8217;m a virtual girl in a virtual world. I&#8217;m too old to still be called a &#8220;geek&#8221;. But back in the early 1990s I was one of the top Internet evangelists in my own country; these days, I have the same enthusiasm in promoting online virtual worlds and a lifestyle based on providing services over them, which naturally also raises the issue of identity.</p>
<p>In early 2004 I was stalked over the Internet. A small group of petty criminals, who were actually not very computer-literate, nevertheless managed to figure out, based on IP address and other similar, simple, easy-to-find hints, if I was at home, at work, or someplace else. This allowed them to track me down in order to blackmail me; I had earned the reputation of being rich (a rumour spread by a former associate) and this encouraged all sorts of small criminals, scammers, and others to help me to relieve me from the alleged vast fortune I had amassed during the golden days of the Internet revolution&#8230;</p>
<p>Because police work in my country is too slow — and the criminals know that — due to judiciary bureaucracy, I had no other option but to move far, far away from my home, leaving my contacts to my lawyer and close family, and live in a tiny rented room on a flat with little else but a bed, a tiny fridge, a micro-wave oven, and a shower in the bathroom. I had no fixed job, a salary below the poverty line, and not a single cent in my name; all I had was some clothes and a computer.</p>
<p>Since most of my work was done remotely, I made a decision: I would shut down all messengers, stop participating on forums, chatrooms, and similar online venues under my own name. I even stopped blogging, something I had done irregularly since 1995. Instead, I went completely pseudonymous, thanks mostly to Second Life, which I had &#8220;discovered&#8221; in mid-2004. In Second Life, nobody really knows who you are — and nobody truly cares. So slowly I started picking up all my social networking functions, including <a href="http://gwynethllewelyn.net">blogging</a>, and even started participating online far more than before. But this time it was under my pseudonym.</p>
<p>Ironically, I even created a <a href="http://betatechnologies.info">new company</a>, where nobody but the partners knew my true identity. Contracts were signed with my pseudonym; meetings with customers were mostly done online (in Second Life) or just by exchanging emails or text messages. The company is still around and doing business, and very few know my real name or identity, but that was never an obstacle in providing good services and establishing a solid reputation.</p>
<p>I gave some <a href="http://treet.tv/shows/tonightlive/episodes/ep099">live interviews</a> (and lots of written ones) and did <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GwynethLlewelyn/">remote presentations using my avatar</a>; I wrote <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/secondfest/story/0,,2100437,00.html">an article for the Guardian under my pseudonym</a> (as well for <a href="http://alphavilleherald.com/2007/08/linden-labs-met.html">many</a> <a href="http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2007/09/gwyneth-llewely.html">sites</a> as a <a href="http://analutetia.com/2009/06/22/anatomy-of-lag/">guest</a> blogger); I even have a few academic articles waiting to be published (and a few references from fellow researchers) and to this very day, almost all online registrations I constantly do use my pseudonym pretty much everywhere. Beyond Second Life, I&#8217;m also active in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/gwynethllewelyn">WordPress community</a>. The result of all this activity is the oddity that Google or Bing list ten or twenty times more results for my pseudonym than for my so-called &#8220;real&#8221; identity, which is pretty much &#8220;invisible&#8221; on the Internet.</p>
<p>Living for seven years under an assumed pseudonym which has a much vaster impact on the &#8216;net audience than my real identity started to make me question issues about identity and, ultimately, the self. Perhaps it&#8217;s no coincidence that I&#8217;ve also started to become a serious Dharma practitioner, which definitely helps one to experimentally find answers about one&#8217;s self, and these are radically opposite to what the likes of Facebook and Google <em>think</em> about identity <img src="http://mynameisme.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>People have pseudonyms because of privacy or safety. My mom has told me that people can search the past of the internet &#8211; that&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t give out your real name or age in case people look me up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mynameisme.org/files/2011/08/2011-08-15-00.35.02.jpg"><img src="http://mynameisme.org/files/2011/08/2011-08-15-00.35.02-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-575" /></a></p>
<p>My name is Talel Amira. It&#8217;s my real name, and I&#8217;m happy and proud today that I can use it. I&#8217;m a Tunisian citizen living in Canada (Quebec).</p>
<p>Not too long ago I used to be 2 different persons: One person who had the name Talel, and another person who had Talel&#8217;s ideas, and those two persons were not meant to meet because my safety could suffer. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m from Tunisia, where less than 8 months ago the country was under a strong dictatorship, so I couldn&#8217;t express my real ideas as mine. Talel was talking about the weather, some geek stuff that he likes, his job. On the other side, the other person expressed the real ideas of Talel and this person was forced to name himself with a pseudonym because he sometimes needed to log into a forum, a social media site, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy that today I&#8217;m recovering from this<em> e-schizophrenia</em>, and that I can consider my two persons as the same whether in life or on the web. </p>
<p>But what makes me happier is that I could continue to live my two lives, but I made the choice not to. Now I understand that the problem is not about pseudonyms vs. real names, it is just about the freedom of choice. I prefer to use my real name, others don&#8217;t, not because they don&#8217;t want to, but sometimes because they simply cannot.</p>
<p>Sometimes we cannot use our real names, and I will always remember the books of the Algerian author &#8220;Yassmina Khadra&#8221;, a woman with great style whose books are a real pleasure. A couple of years after her first book we discovered that this woman was in fact a man with a man&#8217;s name. Did I feel betrayed? Absolutely not. The use of a pseudonym was intended just to protect the writer, and the reading pleasure was the same; the author could through his book create a genuine link with the reader, and all I needed was a way to identify him just to buy his books; I would still be happy if he were identified with a number.</p>
<p>I think that such an example is proof that it doesn&#8217;t matter how you call yourself or how people call you: You have the right to be who you want to be. </p>
<p>And, you didn&#8217;t choose your very first name, so why should someone now prevent you from naming yourself &#8220;Superman&#8221; if you want to?</p>

I am a technical writer, a Sunday school teacher, a knitter, and a believer in online privacy. My spouse and I met online and fell in love. In time we got married and had two children, who we are raising as digital natives.</p>
<p>Before they were born, my children had Amazon wishlists and email accounts. Before they could read, they played online games. And before we set them loose on the internet, we explained over and over again that they should never ever tell anyone on the internet their real name, or where they lived, or how old they were. Their father and I know that the internet is full of unknowable people who seem plausible and safe, and are not. We know because we were both lied to and stalked as adults.</p>
<p>My son Baz has been playing a multiplayer online game called Roblox for over a year now. His peers there know him by a nickname derived from his email address. They don&#8217;t know or care that he is in elementary school. They care whether he can script a door lock or use chat at speed, which he can. Roblox uses a small monthly fee to comply with the federal regulations about children under 13 being online only with parental permission. Free services cannot verify that users are over 13, and so habitually lock them out. This is miserable for my young digital native. He would like to be able to move as freely through the internet as anyone else, not exist in child-oriented ghettos.</p>
<p>To be able to move freely and with some degree of safety, he needs to be pseudonymous. He needs to lie about his birthdate. He needs to be able to shield his identity while he is easily victimized, and change it in the future to separate his preteen self from his professional self.</p>
<p>I want him to be able to make stupid mistakes without them being findable by his future employers, college professors, or dates. The internet is forever, but as long as we don&#8217;t use our employee names, we will not get turned down for work because of the online equivalent of facial tattoos.</p>
<p>My name is Heidi Waterhouse. I am teaching my children to be safe and pseudonymous. I think it matters.</p>

My name is islamoyankee. I grew up in an age where you had three letters to put your name in electronic gadgets. I used to be &#8220;WIZ.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t trying to hide who I was or be duplicitous. It&#8217;s the way the machines made us name ourselves. WIZ became my gaming name. I was still Hussein, but only when it involved electronics.</p>
<p>With the advent of social media, especially blogging, and the longer names that technological advancement allowed, I took the name &#8220;islamoyankee.&#8221; I had outgrown WIZ, so WIZARD did not seem appropriate and who I was had also changed.</p>
<p>I lived through 9/11. My Muslim identification became more important. I read an article about the two things the French fear/hate: Americans and Muslims. The author of the article coined the term &#8220;islamoyankee.&#8221; I appropriated it to describe me as being a proud New Yorker and committed Muslim.</p>
<p>Online I am islamoyankee. I didn&#8217;t name my blog, <em><a href="http://www.islamicate.com/">islamicate</a></em>, after myself, but after an idea. The idea is that Muslims are not Islam, and that they are people who are engaged in creating culture. Some of that culture is religiously defined, and some of it not. It is culture that is constructed with non-Muslims as well. I don&#8217;t use my name real name in talking about these ideas, because I want a name that also engages with them. I built a virtual identity blogging, on YouTube, on Twitter, and on Flickr to engage with this basic principle.</p>
<p>islamoyankee is not divorced from my given name. I am Hussein to my friends and family. I am Dr. or Prof. Rashid to my students and colleagues. As the latter, academic and professional, identification gained prominence in physical interaction, it&#8217;s bled into my online life. My role with Religion Dispatches started from my islamoyankee reputation. However, it developed based on my Hussein Rashid reputation.</p>
<p>I am islamoyankee. I am Hussein. There is no difference. I am just called different things in different contexts. Online I have a primary way I interact with people, and that is talking about Muslims specifically, and religion generally, in America. So my name, as you read this online, is islamoyankee. In person, you can call me Hussein.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mynameisme.org/files/2011/08/flavia-dzodan.jpeg"><img src="http://mynameisme.org/files/2011/08/flavia-dzodan-272x300.jpg" alt="Flavia Dzodan" width="272" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-541" /></a></p>
<p>My name is Flavia Dzodan.  I live in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I am a writer, an activist and ideas instigator who bases her political affiliations, activism, and work on the rights of minorities and immigrants living in Europe. My work has appeared in publications like The Guardian and I am also an editor at <a href="http://tigerbeatdown.com/">Tiger Beatdown</a>. I have been interviewed by major Dutch publications like <em>De Volkskrant</em> over my views and opinions of Dutch society. Additionally, I am a member of one of Amsterdam&#8217;s main political parties, where I am active within my community to raise awareness of discrimination and institutional practices that seek to alienate those of non-Dutch origin.</p>
<p>I write under my government name because I wish to give visibility to the realities of being a minority and an immigrant in an environment that is growing increasingly hostile to diversity and giving preeminence to outdated notions of nationalism and xenophobia. I have the privilege of writing under my government name because I am a documented, legal resident of the country I live in. However, this privilege is not awarded to everyone.</p>
<p>Political refugees fear for the fate of family, friends, and communities still living in their home countries. Bearing witness to the acts that forced them to leave their homes comes with a price. In cases like these, pseudonymity is not just a matter of hiding one&#8217;s identity but of protecting the very livelihood of those left behind.</p>
<p>Many come to Europe seeking asylum. North African migrants arrive at the coast of European countries and are placed in temporary internment camps, only to be released at a later date without a clear legal status. While their applications are processed, the asylum seeker is left voiceless, unable to speak of their experience. This whole process can take a decade or longer. Speaking about this injustice under one&#8217;s government name comes with great risk, the asylum seeker faces further internment in a camp or deportation. In these cases, a pseudonym, a new identity, is an absolute necessity.</p>
<p>Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, fear the consequences of speaking up against injustice and discrimination. Many are victims of crimes that they cannot report because doing so would bring their residency claims into question. Women migrants are systematically targeted for sexual harassment and abuse because perpetrators know that the chances of police involvement are minimal. If an immigrant wishes to seek support in online communities and safe spaces, doing so under their government name would put them under the spotlight of authorities.</p>
<p>By enforcing a policy of &#8220;Only government names are allowed&#8221;, we are denying all of these people a voice. We are confining them to a silenced category where we remove their right to even discuss the injustices inflicted upon them. We are complicit in their double victimization.</p>
