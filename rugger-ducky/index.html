Here is the story of my name, and why it matters to me:</p>
<p>In the fall of 1992, during the Clinton campaign when the big debate was allowing gay people to serve in the military (before the cop-out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_ask,_don't_tell">DADT</a> that broke my heart and will to serve), I was going through a difficult time coming to terms with my own sexuality.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d joined the Army just a couple weeks after my 17 birthday, and for all intents and purposes was basically asexual in high school. I didn&#8217;t have the foggiest clue who I was, who I would grow to be, or what I even wanted in life. When asked at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Entrance_Processing_Command">MEPS</a> the old question of  &#8220;Are you homosexual or have you ever engaged in homosexual activities,&#8221; I answered as honestly as I knew how &#8220;No.&#8221; I just assumed I was as straight as my siblings, and that eventually I&#8217;d find a guy I liked.</p>
<p>So eventually I served through the Army for almost 4 years, trying to deny my sexuality to myself and everyone else. I tried everything I could think of to “make myself straight,” but I didn’t realize how little I was fooling anyone else or even myself.</p>
<p>Eventually my friends finally took pity on me after I turned 21 and they could take me out to the gay bar. They’d been debating for some time, apparently, who it was going to be, but finally settled on our friend Stephanie as the sucker to drag me to the gay bar the first time. I was already drunk that night from an evening of brain-knocking flag football followed by all the margaritas I could drink at our local frozen watering hole. Stephanie and a few others asked “Hey, who wants to go to the club?”</p>
<p>In my head, I think they’re referring to “Club Monterey,” which at the time was the hottest dance bar in the small city. Of course I’m all “Sure, let’s go!” We go outside, everyone splits up into different cars, and I’m told to jump into Stephanie’s vehicle. On the ride over, she says “I’m not so sure about this, but Kit-Kat (one of our mutual friends) says you’re ‘family,’ so I guess it&#8217;s ok.”</p>
<p>Now I was still in denial, but I’d been hanging around lesbians and gay men long enough by then to know what ‘family’ meant in that context. I immediately countered that I was not actually gay. She then told me we were actually going to a gay bar, and asked if I wanted to go home instead. I responded that all our friends were already headed there, and I didn’t want to ruin the party. She agreed to tell the others that I was “straight” and make sure no one tried to grab my ass or any of my other bits, as I was clearly terrified was going to happen if I walked into a gay bar.</p>
<p>The bar was like any other, really, and all my friends were there. I quickly realized that it actually beat going to straight bars, because I wasn’t having to fend off drunk guys. On the way home, I asked Stephanie “Why does everyone think I’m gay?”</p>
<p>To this day, I can’t thank her enough. She spent two full hours sitting in the cab of her pickup truck in the parking lot outside my barracks telling me the truth. I still wasn’t quite ready to accept it, but I was willing to listen at least.</p>
<p>I kept going back to the bar with my friends after that. Still working up the courage to admit what everyone else already knew. One night a friend of a friend I didn’t know well started hassling me in the bar. “If you’re not gay, why are you here?” she kept asking, over and over. Please realize, this was in the early ‘90s, just prior to DADT being passed, and fear of being publicly outed and losing your career was almost crippling for some people. Witch hunts were frequent and a constant topic of discussion.</p>
<p>As we were all leaving the bar together to walk back to our cars that night, she asked me again, on the main street of town. I was tired of answering “Because my friends are here,” and retorted, “Well, how do you know I’m not CID*?”</p>
<p>She immediately spun around, and for a moment, I thought I’d pushed back too hard and was going to get punched. Before I could react to anything, she grabbed my face and full on kissed me on the mouth, then let me go. I stepped back, sputtering and unable to say anything.</p>
<p>She shook her head, smiled at me, and said “Nope, you’re not CID. Walks like a duck, talks like a duck, acts like a duck, hangs out with ducks, must be a duck&#8230;”</p>
<p>Since all my closest friends were standing there, they all started laughing and the nickname of Ducky was born. At first I was obviously reluctant to get called that, but as time went on and I came out finally, I became ok with it. Eventually even grew to like it. When I left the Army after DADT went through the following summer, I moved to Georgia and enough of my friends were stationed there that the name followed me as well.</p>
<p>I’m proud to continue to bear the name. It has followed me for nearly 20 years, and has served me well. I’ve used it at work, at home, and its what my oldest and dearest friends (and my wife) call me. That’s me. Ducky.</p>
<p>*<a href="http://www.cid.army.mil/">Criminal Investigation Division</a>. The dirty bastards who spend their careers trying to fuck over other soldiers in any way possible. They used to send people to gay bars to pretend they were gay and get names. They’d even stand in parking lots and write down license plate numbers that had military base stickers.</p>
