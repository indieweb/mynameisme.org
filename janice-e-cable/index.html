<p>My name is Janice E. Cable, but for over six years, I’ve been writing under a pseudonym, <a title="chelsea g. summers" href="http://chelseasummers.com/">chelsea g. summers</a>. In March 2005, I began my blog, <a title="pretty dumb things" href="http://prettydumbthings.typepad.com/">pretty dumb things</a>, under the name “chelsea girl” because I was a Ph.D. candidate at a Catholic college, and I was teaching college classes as part of that program. I needed to protect my identity because I wrote about deeply personal, very sexual topics, including stories about my past as a stripper—and because I also wanted to protect those about whom I wrote. Within a year and a half, my blog had gotten fairly popular, and my writing was increasingly moving beyond my blog into published matter. I gave myself a last name and I christened myself chelsea g. summers.</p>
<p>Under this name, I was published by Penthouse and GQ here in the States and New Woman and Scarlet magazines in the UK. Under this name, my work appeared on multiple websites like Yahoo Dating and Filthy Gorgeous Things, and in several anthologies, including some edited by Rachel Kramer Bussel and Tristan Taormino. Under this name, I was interviewed by legendary sex writer Susie Bright, and under this name, I edited a column for Fleshbot, the porn arm of Gawker Media. For a while, my blog averaged 5,000 readers a day, sometimes jumping to 10,000 readers if the fates joined together and conspired to send conspicuous hordes of people my way. I felt honored and a bit flabbergasted, but it was cool.</p>
<p>My popularity also got me stalkers. It all began in tiny drips of venom, hurtful words in the comments of my blog, but after I protected the comment section of my blog, it turned into a steady torrent of emails, each one from differently named people, each one bilious, and all of them converging on similar themes: how I was fat, how I was a loser because my parents supported me (they didn’t), how my writing was bad, how ugly I was, how I was a whore, and how I was abnormal in the choices I’d made in my life. Although the names of the senders were all different, the style and the themes remained the same in these many emails. Sometimes the writer would tailor the content to reflect something I’d recently written, but essentially it was all the same message. I sucked, and the writer would be quite happy if I died.</p>
<p>I received somewhere over 300 emails between June 2006 and October 2010. Sometimes the writer would threaten real life presence; for example, when I announced that I was giving a reading, the email writer would tell me that he (or she) would be there. Sometimes the writer pretended to be someone with intimate knowledge of my past or my present and threatened to tell others. Of course, I contacted the authorities. However, because no outward threats had been made, and because my stalkers only said mean things, there was nothing anyone could do. Even when my stalkers spent their New Year’s Eve on 2006 bombarding online college professors review sites by writing comments that linked my pseudonymic writing to my professional self in a place that my students, as well as my administration, could read it, the authorities could do nothing. No one, in fact, could do anything.</p>
<p>Here’s the kicker: my stalkers, a husband and a wife who lived in Rhode Island (I know who they are), used “real” names. They weren’t their real names, of course, but they looked “real.” They used names like Lynn Callahan, Jan Nicklaus, Greg Eppy, Mike Barnes, Ken Cassidy, Myrna Byrnes, Lena McCallister, and Tim Payne. Some names were more farcical—Miso Devine and Mike Huckabee stand out as preposterous—but they were all plausible. And there’s no way to trace the addresses on Gmail, which assigns a unique IP address to each and every email, not without access to the kind of tracking software that only the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have access to. In short, knowing who these people are neither deterred them nor did it help me.</p>
<p>The point being that, however well intentioned, a “Real Name” policy wouldn’t have protected me. There is nothing in place that separates a real John Smith from a fake one, and in a world where verisimilitude and plausibility are enough to pass some test of veracity, a stalker by any other name is still a stalker. I was hounded by stalkers with “real” names for over four years. I got angry, but I couldn’t get much more than that.</p>
<p>I’ve not yet been hurt professionally by my stalkers, though I suppose it’s possible that I could be. I certainly spent many months depressed and anxious because of them and their campaign of hate. Because of their efforts, my students did find out about my blog, and I suppose that it’s a testament to my teaching that not a single one of them cared. My pseudonymic identity didn’t protect me, but neither would have a “Real Name” policy. Ironically, my stalkers’ pseudonyms—combined with my good heart—do protect them. I could name names, but why? I’m better than that.</p>
<p>Here’s something I’ve never written anywhere before: I, Janice E. Cable, am chelsea g. summers. I’m telling you who I am because I believe we all have a right to express ourselves without fear of harassment. I believe in taking a stand. And I believe that our actions show who we are, no matter what we choose to call ourselves.</p>
