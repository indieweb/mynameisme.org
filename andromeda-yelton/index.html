<p>My name is Andromeda Yelton, and I&#8217;m a librarian and startup employee at <a href="http://www.gluejar.com">Gluejar</a>: my professional life is defined by access to information.  I used to be a teacher.  I used to be someone not named Andromeda.  And I have interesting friends.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about their brilliance, creativity, and charisma, although they have that in glorious abundance. I’m talking about their hacking, their bondage parties, their experience with drugs.</p>
<p>I’m glad I know people who have had these experiences, and are willing to talk about them.  I like having friends who come from diverse perspectives so that my world can be bigger than my own history.</p>
<p>But I used to be a teacher. And let me tell you, when I was a teacher, there was no way I would have admitted that I knew these people, online, under my own name.</p>
<p>To be quite clear: I’m not ashamed. Their activities aren’t shameful. They’re not immoral. But they are sometimes illegal, and they’re hard to explain. And when I was a teacher, I lived in fear that some parent would discover I associated with people like that, and insist I be removed from contact with children. Or that my students would discover these things and use them to destroy my authority in the classroom. In fact, I was once harassed by students who had Googled me.  They found echoes of me at their age, presenting myself to a different audience, and accordingly treated me as they would, not a teacher, but a 15-year-old nerd.</p>
<p>Had a real names policy been ubiquitous while I was teaching, I would have had to choose between my job and engaging with my friends online. Not “I could have had to”, if some parent had hit the ceiling, if some student had handled my friends’ lives with the maturity level of an average middle schooler. I would have had to, because the chilling effects of that policy would have prevented me from engaging online with my friends at all.</p>
<p>Pseudonymity let me do both. Pseudonymity lets us do the same thing that meatspace constraints have always: present different aspects of ourselves to different social contexts while remaining within social norms — even when the presentation of those same aspects in other contexts would violate norms. Meatspace lets us do this all under one name because sound and light fade, because meatspace is seldom recorded or indexed or searchable, because we can see the people we’re interacting with and make choices accordingly. The post-Google internet gives us none of those affordances, but gives us — gave us? — instead: names. We can name and group our contexts and aspects to give us the shelter of local social norms. We can be a part of the norms that matter to us, even when they are out of favor with some more dominant norm that can hurt us if we publicly violate it.</p>
<p>Policies that force us to present all aspects of ourselves under our dominant-culture name are policies which threaten our expression of the aspects of ourselves which do not conform to that dominant culture, and to engage with nonconformist communities. And the degree to which that is a threat is exactly the degree to which people already do not fit into the dominant norm. It is the reason why lists of who is harmed by a real names policy are teeming with people who belong to some minority, espouse a locally unpopular belief, or are already vulnerable for other reasons: lesbian and gay teenagers; women who have experienced stalking or violence; members of minority religions; dissidents. The reason they most need a pseudonym to engage with their communities is the reason they are most threatened if pseudonyms are forbidden.</p>
<p>Ever since I was that misfit teenager, I have participated in online communities under persistent pseudonyms — whether because as an adolescent I wanted safe spaces to be nerdy, or as teacher I wanted to separate parts of myself from my public persona, or simply because I don’t want everything of me to be available and traceable to everyone who knows my unique real name.  In this capacity I’ve real relationships with other people operating under pseudonyms. I met two people I like and respect tremendously in a community where I have been rigorous about never associating my real name; nor did I know theirs for years.</p>
<p>In fact, I am engaging with you now under, arguably, a pseudonym.  “Andromeda” was not my name at birth, but it is my real name in every way that matters: I have been going by it since I was 13; it has been my legal name since I was 18; it is on all my government ID except my birth certificate. It is the name that is associated with nearly all of my professional and social accomplishments. It is my name.</p>
<p>This is why, if people tell me their name is <a href="http://www.danah.org/name.html">danah</a> (uncapitalized) or <a href="http://infotrope.net/bio/my-name/">Skud</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_8._Lee">Jennifer 8. Lee</a>, if people tell me they’re transitioning and have an opposite-gender name now, that is damn well what I am going to call them, because anything less would be a mark of profound disrespect.</p>
<p>Anything less would be me trying to colonize their identity: to tell them their assessment of who they are matters less than mine. And this is what real-names policies do. They posit that some normative concept of our identity has primacy over our own understanding of it; they rip away structures that allow us to participate respectfully in communities with diverse norms, and in doing so privilege the most mainstream of those norms; they threaten people who are already vulnerable by removing their ability to engage with communities where certain parts of themselves are safe.</p>
<p>My name, my real name, is Andromeda Yelton.  It’s nice to meet you.</p>
